I am particularly interested in ways in which such evolution can influence the persistence of populations or contribute to structuring of associated communities and ecosystems through dynamic feedbacks.  Much of this work takes place in the context of conservation biology and natural resource management, but sometimes also considers evolutionary challnges tied to agriculture and human health.  In addition to some model fish species used to study these questions, my lab also studies these questions within the context of regionally important fish and amphibian populations that are likely to be particularly affected by climate change due to their location at the southern or northern extent of their species ranges.
